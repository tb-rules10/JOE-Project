## Proposed Methodology

Firstly we will set up a Raspberry Pl and install ‘Motion’ in Raspberry Pi for video feed along with an appropriate camera, after which we will work with the required hardware components and build a prototype. 
We will use the HTML code and make a server which would help us to  control the robot from a web browser. We will also use Python to program the raspberry pi.
