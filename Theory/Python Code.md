# Python Code for Surveillance Robot 

The python code for this Surveillance Robot is given [here](https://github.com/tb-rules10/JOE-Project/blob/main/SurveillanceRobot/robot.py). 
Copy this code and save it inside the SurveillanceRobot folder by using the following commands:

`cd SurveillanceRobot`

`sudo nano robot.py`

In the python code, there are five functions for moving the robot Forward, Left, Right, Reverse, and Stop. Five different integers are assigned to these five functions. 
Received integer from the web page will be saved in a variable named changePin, and it will be compared with all the functions. So when we press the Forward button 
on the web page, it will send one and based on that, the robot will move in the forward direction.
