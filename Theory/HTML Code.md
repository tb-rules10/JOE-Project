# HTML Code for Surveillance Robot 

A webpage is created using HTML to control the robot and for displaying the video feed. In this HTML code, we have assigned different integers for different direction buttons. 
For example, 1 for Forward and 2 for Left. So whenever the Forward button is pressed on the web page, it will send 1.

Create a directory named SurveillanceRobot, and inside this directory, create a new folder called templates. Then copy the below code and save it inside the templates folder 
as index.html.
