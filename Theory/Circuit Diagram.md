In this project, we donâ€™t need to make many connections. We only need to connect two DC motors to the raspberry pi using the L293D Motor driver module. After this, mount the DC motors and Raspberry Pi to the robot chassis. The four pins (A1, A2, and B1, B2) of the motor driver module are connected to the GPIO pins 18, 23, 24 & 25 of Raspberry Pi.
