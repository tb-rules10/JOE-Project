After completing all the setups and mounting the Raspberry Pi on Robot chassis, run the python code. Then open Raspberry Pi IP address with port 8000 (http://192.168.1.207:8000) in a web browser. Now we will see video streaming on the left side of the page and control buttons on the right side of the page as shown in the below image.
